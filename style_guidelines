IEEE Uniandes Website Style Guide

1. Introduction & Design Philosophy

This style guide provides a comprehensive overview of the visual and user interface standards for the IEEE Student Branch at Universidad de los Andes website. The goal is to maintain a consistent, professional, and modern brand identity across all pages and components. This guide is designed to be a living document, adaptable to future design trends and technological advancements.

Core Principles:

- Modern & Tech-Focused: The design should reflect the cutting-edge nature of IEEE and its members. This is achieved through a dark theme, vibrant neon accents, and subtle animations.
- Professional & Trustworthy: As an official student branch of a prestigious organization, the website must convey credibility and professionalism. This is reflected in the clean layout, consistent typography, and organized structure.
- Engaging & User-Friendly: The website should be intuitive and easy to navigate for all users, from prospective members to industry partners. Interactive elements and clear calls-to-action are key to achieving this.
- AI-Development Friendly: This guide is structured to be easily parsed by large language models. By providing clear definitions for colors, typography, components, and layouts, we can leverage AI to accelerate development and ensure consistency.

2. Awwwards-Inspired Enhancements

To elevate the website's aesthetic and move beyond a basic design, we will adopt a dark-themed, visually rich style inspired by Awwwards-winning websites.

Key Features:

- Dark Theme as Primary: The entire website will use a dark background, creating a sophisticated and immersive experience.
- Neon Accents: Vibrant, neon colors will be used for highlights, calls-to-action, and decorative elements to create a futuristic and energetic feel.
- Layered Backgrounds: We will use a combination of subtle gradients, blurred shapes, and floating geometric elements to add depth and visual interest to the background.
- Glassmorphism/Aurora UI: Components like cards and navigation bars will feature blurred, semi-transparent backgrounds to create a "glass-like" effect.
- Micro-interactions & Animations: Subtle animations on hover, scroll, and page load will be used to create a more dynamic and engaging user experience.
